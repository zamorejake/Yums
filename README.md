## Installation

Clone the repo, run `npm i`, create your .env file with your private stripe key or the development private key as STRIPE_PRIVATE to get stripe to work. Next navigate to the main folder and run npm run develop to get the front and back end to run. After that run `npm run seed` to populate the database and then run `npm run develop` to build the project and run.

## Usage

npm i, npm run seed, and npm run develop. When checking out with stripe we used the test key so we didn't have to use our credit card to test it, so the default stripe testing info is typing "42" repeatedly
